### What is CDN?

- It is a mechanism to request resources from an external server so that the **latency rate is reduced**.

### What is CORS?

- It is a mechanism where **two applications** are running on **different servers**, allowing scripts to share data between them.
- If a script asks for a resource, the other server responds accordingly.
- If it involves storing or accessing **critical data**, the server may request **authentication rights**.
- This mechanism is referred to as **Cross Origin Resource Sharing**.
